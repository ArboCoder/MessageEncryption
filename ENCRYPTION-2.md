## BASICS
 
Every alphabetical character is shifted 4 characters to the RIGHT on the **US Keyboard Layout**.  
After the letter is shifted, you have to get the number it comes from on the alphabet.  
If the number is an odd number, shift it 2 characters to the LEFT.  
If the number is an even number, shift it 3 characters to the RIGHT.  
If the final result letter is a vowel, replace it with the character underneath it.  

## Example Explanation

`H` ->
For example, `H` would turn to `A`. `A` is the first letter of the alphabet. 1 is an odd number, so `H` (original number) would turn into `F`.

## Examples

`Hey` ->  
`Fdo`
